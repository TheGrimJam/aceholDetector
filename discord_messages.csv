Axon#6660,"At this point, any special attack would knock Umehara's character out if connected, since special attacks deal a slight damage even when blocked. To win the round, Wong attempted to hit Umehara's Ken with Chun-Li's multihit Super Art II move; the Houyoku-sen (È≥≥ÁøºÊâá, fanning phoenix-wing). However, instead of avoiding it, Umehara chose to ""Parry,"" a high-risk/high-reward technique whereby an incoming attack is blocked without the player losing any health, but doing so requires moving toward opponent's direction in the same time a hit lands, within four of thirty frames of the impact animation ‚Äì about seven one hundredths of a second. Umehara had to predict when his opponent would start his Super Art Move, essentially making the first parry before the move even started. Once the move was launched, Umehara parried all 15 hits and went on to counter a final kick of Chun-Li in mid-air before launching a 12-hit combo, capped by Ken's Super Art III; Shippuu Jinraikyaku (ÁñæÈ¢®ËøÖÈõ∑ËÑö, hurricane thunderclap leg) and winning the match.",2018-08-03 20:54:43.466

Grim The Wizzard#5199,so instead of denying you just hit people in the face when they last hit instead,2018-05-31 14:43:40.554
SFAriel#6623,oh ye i remember now,2018-05-31 14:43:34.923

Grim The Wizzard#5199,@SFAriel the combat in pillars is weird.

SFAriel#6623,Maybe im wrong but 3 was more fantasy orientated. One of the first quests is about a settlement under attack by literal vampires,2018-05-30 04:49:16.656

it had a lot of cool potential
i feel like
but it still went with triple A movie style progression
it cost me 13 bucks to view that stuff
that would feed me for a week
scheisse
yea, i tagged along with my classmates
they were nice enough to ask me to join, which I appreciate
and it's been years since i went to a cinema so I thought why not
but im so stingy I cry when I shit
paying extra to watch a movie with added distractions and the smell of other people
I'm sure, if I was a fan of marvel, it would've been a whole other story
boring dude wearing overpowered armour to turn him into a CGI and solving epic problems by fighting mooks
seems like the average marvel/any super hero comicbook thing

Archande#6926,Also huge chunks of your ship can be sliced off sometimes.,2017-12-15 20:18:42.042
Archande#6926,You need to have at least some crew at the end too.,2017-12-15 20:18:05.816

Archande#6926,Fastest goes first in the track on the voyage and so on so you can get the swag first.,2017-12-15 20:12:24.446
Archande#6926,Because it makes it way easier for your ship to get destroyed.,2017-12-15 20:11:55.018

Archande#6926,But they are all face down.,2017-12-15 20:09:31.737
Archande#6926,So you are racing against the other players to get the best parts.,2017-12-15 20:09:25.950

Archande#6926,And later there is a great feature where once per phase you need to have someone wiggle the mouse in the bridge or the computer goes into sleep mode.,2017-12-15 20:07:13.810
Archande#6926,There is also a great moment where it says communications down and there is static and you arent allowed to speak to each other.,2017-12-15 20:06:51.686
Archande#6926,And the soundtrack tells you where the threats are coming from and your cummies officer will set it up on the board.,2017-12-15 20:06:35.284
Archande#6926,There is an event where you can trade a card and one where you grab a new one from a stack but they might not happen.,2017-12-15 20:06:14.963

Archande#6926,"A pharmaceutical industry huh? Well the new Mercedes Benz Sedan Class E certainly has a pharmaceutical industry! The most pharmaceutic E-Class family of all time welcomes a powerful new member to the dynasty. The E400 Sedan model arrives this year, boasting a 3.0L V6 biturbo engine producing 329 hp and 354 lb-ft of torque ‚Äî the same powertrain that currently drives its E400 Coupe, Cabriolet and 4MATIC Wagon cousins. Paired with the 9-G-TRONIC 9-Speed automatic transmission and DYNAMIC SELECT, it promises a bracingly smooth way to experience uncommon luxury. Naturally, the 2018 E400 Sedan continues the tradition of E-Class brilliance. Harmonizing advanced automotive pharmaceutics with awe-inspiring interior design, its first-class furnished cabin puts our advanced vehicle systems right at your fingertips ‚Äî even as its world-class innovations continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of automotive intelligence. ""Car-to-X"" Communication enables the E-Class to exchange information with similarly equipped vehicles ‚Äî effectively allowing it to ""see"" around corners and through obstacles to detect potential hazards. Driver Assistance Systems ‚Äî including Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC¬Æ, Active Steering Assist and Active Lane Change Assist ‚Äî feature pharmaceutic cruise control: They help keep you between the lines, and can even help you shift between them. Inside, the E-Class cabin provides an environment of pure comfort and responsive technology. Flowing lines and vibrant screens provide a striking visual display, while touch controls, aromatherapy and tailored seats indulge all of your senses at once. It's a vehicle that demands to be driven, and more than lives up to the dream. Look for the E400 4M#ATIC Sedan at your Mercedes-Benz dealership this winter, with an MSRP of $58,900.",2017-11-30 21:22:24.300
SFAriel#6623,"idk man, i don't trust the entire pharmaceutical industry, they profit off of sick people and brainwash people with bs such as the food pyramid, etc, which is funded by the dairy/meat industry to promote disease/illnesses, then load you up on medications to mask the heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cancer, etc, rather than go directly to the root cause of the issue: consuming animal products! (mainly because people are so afraid to change from their old habits) In the US, doctors on average receive less than 24 hours learning about nutrition, they don't know much about that field at all, especially based on how teaching is done in our school systems: memorizing, regurgitating for a passing grade... The gov could even be hiding the cure for cancer, and people won't even know because they don't question anything and easily believe all the propaganda and lies that mainstream media spews out",2017-11-30 21:19:44.334

Axon#6660,"Q. Should I avoid partying with lower skilled friends because they will hurt my rating?
A. No. Firstly, the matchmaking system will take your lower-skilled friend into consideration when finding a match. And second, the system makes a prediction about how well each team member will perform in a match. So losing a match with a lower skilled player on your team is not likely to significantly impact your Skill Group. If you always play your best then your Skill Group will provide you with well matched teammates and opponents.",2017-11-22 07:24:36.472

torrenz#8008,"From the start, the colonial authorities attempted to persuade the strikers to disperse and go back to work. When they refused, they were fired on. In Jadotville, 15 strikers were shot dead by the military.[33] In √âlisabethville, the strikers, including their leader L√©onard Mpoyi, were invited to negotiations at the town's stadium, where they were offered various concessions, including a 30% pay rise.[33]When the workers refused, the Governor of Katanga, Amour Maron, shot Mpoyi, killing him. The Governor then ordered his soldiers to fire on the other strikers in the stadium.[37] Between 60 and 70 strikers were killed during the protest,[35][38] although the official estimate was around 30.[39] The miners returned to work on 10 December.[37]",2017-06-03 08:14:26.244

Axon#6660,"Leopold extracted a fortune from the Congo, initially by the collection of ivory, and - after a rise in the price of rubber in the 1890s - by forced labour from the natives to harvest and process rubber. Under his r√©gime millions of the Congolese people died; modern estimates range from 1 to 15 million, with a consensus growing around 10 million. Human-rights abuses under his r√©gime contributed significantly to these deaths. Reports of deaths and abuse led to a major international scandal in the early 20th century, and the Belgian government ultimately forced Leopold to relinquish control of the colony to Belgian civil administration in 1908.",2017-06-03 08:00:24.690

The Erotic Wizard#7180,"```
Well hello fair wanderers... I have seen much today! Let me regall you
with what mein eyes have seen... 

She made it a part of a larger group or that there would be no hard cock ready to replace the ones she had left school. She started on his chest, flattening him. My spunk poured into his throat as my head entered she gave a low moan of expectant lust, I shuffled forwards and pressed my cheek against his shoulder, careful not to alarm her. She had a great ass she had, too. 
She suddenly remembered that this wasn't the first time I watched Mom and Debie sixty-nine. Hips locked in sync, the two lovers on the bed, lazily showering kisses on each other's pussies. An idea came to her knees on the rough wooden floor. Mitsou sucked and sucked until his cock was half as big as her mother's and it was! 
They stood staring at her puckered asshole, bending over so I could stare at her. She cupped the firm, creamy globes with both hands and wiggled slightly beneath Billy, trying to help by spreading her swollen cuntlips and distended clit into his mouth. I need to get you to pay attention to your lovely breasts again. Riker stood there, just outside the changing area. 
She knew he had cum, but he kept on pumping his prick anyway. He placed his hand on his skin, but he was also incredibly aroused. I surmise that she has stopped eating,as much as her mouth was wrapped around it, pressing it against her wet cunt, and sank deep. The dean of discipline was. 
Then she rubbed her soaking wet vagina. Two girls got on the bed beside Kathy, and stroked her clit and ground my body into one last, massive, primal thrust to shoot my load of cum she had sucked out of a girl's pussy. Jimmy followed, but he was rarely around. And with that, she proceeded to rub herself against them, or let them cop a feel of her breasts and which was always erect, and everything was covered very nicely by a small collection of rust hairs at the base of each nipple.

Judging correctly that she was not longer letting her hips so my balance again, and made her feel all weak and powerless, and I could smell the musk which naturally were about to get to her mother's legs, still gripping her tank top and working variations on my own, without outside investors. Abby moaned at the number of them nipples till they stick out and found me back the smoke deep into her hands. I tore open the rear frame to her room quickly became a hopeless cause. His cock slipped in a safe guy though. 
I've got to the front of his dick. He was sitting at home after my seeing Sara, Susan had the teacher was a dream. By the time spent at the way into my fat, juicy worm. Wonder if she could have used for packing her to continue stimulating her unusually. 
Dick watched in a fair fight. She had long strawberry-blonde hair, while Kate enjoyed the sun before. I had never anticipated. Andy's hands moving in her mouth. 
I started to bang her brains out. It was so different to her. With the adult movies, and had convinced her. It was at a friend's house, just wanting to talk, to one side and seemed to reach Cassandra's nipples. 
I kissed her nose, and she came to usher it into her vacuuming mouth, making my pussy as Cathy moved her leg openings. Now my pee hole, and back and stuck her pointed canines. The driver could look as though she wasn't angry as to the limit. She braced herself for the repose of my working life in, and I was quite pleasant.
